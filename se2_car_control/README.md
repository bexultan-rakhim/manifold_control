### SE2 car dynamics

SE2 car dynamics is a dynamics of a car in 2d plane. simplest car dynamics is given by the following equations:

x_k+1 = x_k + v*dt
y_k+1 = 0
theta_k+1 = w*dt

here, x_k+1, y_k+1, theta_k+1 are NEXT position and angle of the car with respect to the position and orientation of the car in previous timestep dt.
